# Pandas-Tutorials
This repository contains the codes for basic operations performed during Data Analysis using Pandas.

About the dataset:
All Indian Premier League Cricket matches between 2008 and 2016.
This is the ball by ball data of all the IPL cricket matches till season 9.
The dataset contains 2 files: deliveries.csv and matches.csv.
matches.csv contains details related to the match such as location, contesting teams, umpires, results, etc.
deliveries.csv is the ball-by-ball data of all the IPL matches including data of the batting team, batsman, bowler, non-striker, runs scored, etc.

I have also used the most famous "Titanic Dataset" for some topics of Pandas named as train.csv
